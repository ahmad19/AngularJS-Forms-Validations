AngularJS-Forms-Validations
===========================
Please visit for more info on validations: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms
My attempt on validation for email field. Email field validation is quite controversial as it is stated
in the standards that "a@a" is a valid email. But this version of angular js allows it to be invalid which
can help us to use the email field in the forms.

I guess allowing "a@a" as a valid email is the reason for `Facebook` and `Gmail` to use `email` field type as `text`
field in their forms.

Although angularjs's higher version does allow `a@a` to be `valid` as it is stated here:
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5899

My next attempt will be validations for other type of fields in HTML.
